# Versioned JSON save migration

<!-- BEGIN PLAIN ENGLISH -->
## Plain-English explanation

Update an old decoded save record into the current small save format.

1. Read the format version and the gold count.
2. Accept supported old/current versions only.
3. Reject negative or fractional gold counts.
4. Return version two with the same gold amount. Reading and validating JSON text is a separate job in these native kernels.

See [PORTS.md](PORTS.md) for actual inputs, outputs and a worked example. The [beginner guide](../../docs/beginner-guide.md) explains common coding words.

## Mechanic and algorithm

Load a bounded JSON save, migrate a version-one gold field into a version-two inventory, then validate the resulting schema. Return a fresh normalized dictionary so unknown fields do not silently become trusted state.

## Read the implementation

[`python/example.py`](python/example.py) is an independent, standard-library-only Python 3.10+ module. Comments highlight decisions worth changing for your own game. There are no engine dependencies or runtime side effects on import.

## Working example and behavioral check

From the repository root:

```sh
python3 tools/validate.py
python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -p test_genre_mechanics.py -k save_migration -v
```

The corresponding `test_save_migration` in [the test suite](../../tests/test_genre_mechanics.py) demonstrates real calls, expected outputs, and boundary or rejection cases. For interactive use:

```python
import importlib.util
spec = importlib.util.spec_from_file_location("mechanic", "mechanics/save-migration/python/example.py")
mechanic = importlib.util.module_from_spec(spec)
spec.loader.exec_module(mechanic)
# Use the public functions/classes shown in the behavioral test.
```

## Assumptions and limits

Example schema only, no filesystem writes, atomic rename, cloud sync, integrity authentication, or encryption. A local JSON save is user-editable. Standard JSON parsing does not make unbounded hostile input safe.

Tune the rules for your game and extend the tests before integrating. Educational coverage is not a full genre implementation or a production-readiness guarantee. The original Python API is preserved. Eight additional native kernels are available; see the portable contract for their API and scope differences.

## Provenance

Original code written for this repository under the root [MIT license](../../LICENSE). No third-party source or assets were scraped or bundled.

## Portable language versions

Lua, C#, GDScript, TypeScript, JavaScript, C, Rust and Go implementations are documented in [PORTS.md](PORTS.md), including input/output layouts, code links, fixtures, and scope differences from this Python API.
