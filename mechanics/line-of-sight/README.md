# Conservative grid line of sight

## Mechanic and algorithm

Walk every grid cell touched by a line between cell centers. When the line passes exactly through a corner, both adjacent side cells must be clear. This conservative convention prevents seeing diagonally through touching walls.

## Read the implementation

[`python/example.py`](python/example.py) is an independent, standard-library-only Python 3.10+ module. Comments highlight decisions worth changing for your own game. There are no engine dependencies or runtime side effects on import.

## Working example and behavioral check

From the repository root:

```sh
python3 tools/validate.py
python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -p test_genre_mechanics.py -k line_of_sight -v
```

The corresponding `test_line_of_sight` in [the test suite](../../tests/test_genre_mechanics.py) demonstrates real calls, expected outputs, and boundary or rejection cases. For interactive use:

```python
import importlib.util
spec = importlib.util.spec_from_file_location("mechanic", "mechanics/line-of-sight/python/example.py")
mechanic = importlib.util.module_from_spec(spec)
spec.loader.exec_module(mechanic)
# Use the public functions/classes shown in the behavioral test.
```

## Assumptions and limits

2D integer tile coordinates, opaque/nonopaque cells. Does not model partial opacity, heights, lighting, or a perception cone.

Tune the rules for your game and extend the tests before integrating. Educational coverage is not a full genre implementation or a production-readiness guarantee. This entry currently has Python code; other language ports are not present.
