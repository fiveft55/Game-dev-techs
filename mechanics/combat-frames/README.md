# Attack startup, active, and recovery frames

<!-- BEGIN PLAIN ENGLISH -->
## Plain-English explanation

Split an attack into wind-up, dangerous time, and recovery time.

1. During wind-up the attack is not ready to hurt anyone.
2. During active frames an overlapping target may be hit.
3. Remember each target already hit so one swing does not hit it every update.
4. During recovery or after the attack, do not accept new hits.

See [PORTS.md](PORTS.md) for actual inputs, outputs and a worked example. The [beginner guide](../../docs/beginner-guide.md) explains common coding words.

## Mechanic and algorithm

An attack has startup, active, and recovery intervals in integer simulation frames. Resolve at most one hit per defender per attack instance even when hitboxes overlap on consecutive active frames.

## Read the implementation

[`python/example.py`](python/example.py) is an independent, standard-library-only Python 3.10+ module. Comments highlight decisions worth changing for your own game. There are no engine dependencies or runtime side effects on import.

## Working example and behavioral check

From the repository root:

```sh
python3 tools/validate.py
python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -p test_genre_mechanics.py -k combat_frames -v
```

The corresponding `test_combat_frames` in [the test suite](../../tests/test_genre_mechanics.py) demonstrates real calls, expected outputs, and boundary or rejection cases. For interactive use:

```python
import importlib.util
spec = importlib.util.spec_from_file_location("mechanic", "mechanics/combat-frames/python/example.py")
mechanic = importlib.util.module_from_spec(spec)
spec.loader.exec_module(mechanic)
# Use the public functions/classes shown in the behavioral test.
```

## Assumptions and limits

Hitbox geometry is supplied as an overlap decision. No combo parser, animation blending, hitstop, damage calculation, or networking.

Tune the rules for your game and extend the tests before integrating. Educational coverage is not a full genre implementation or a production-readiness guarantee. The original Python API is preserved. Eight additional native kernels are available; see the portable contract for their API and scope differences.

Lua, C#, GDScript, TypeScript, JavaScript, C, Rust and Go implementations are documented in [PORTS.md](PORTS.md), including input/output layouts, code links, fixtures, and scope differences from this Python API.
