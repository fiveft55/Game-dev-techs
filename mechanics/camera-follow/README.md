# Camera smoothing

<!-- BEGIN PLAIN ENGLISH -->
## Plain-English explanation

Make the camera catch up gently instead of snapping straight to its target.

1. Find the gap between the camera and its target.
2. Use the time step and follow strength to choose how much of that gap to close.
3. Move part of the way across the gap.
4. Repeat next update. Bigger strength catches up faster.

See [PORTS.md](PORTS.md) for actual inputs, outputs and a worked example. The [beginner guide](../../docs/beginner-guide.md) explains common coding words.

Status: implemented educational reference; Python 3 standard library.

Exponential smoothing uses elapsed time, so smoothing strength is consistent across frame rates for a stationary target. Moving targets still depend on how they are sampled.

## Read and run

Read [`python/example.py`](python/example.py). Inline comments explain consequential choices. Run all examples' behavioral checks from the repository root with `python3 tools/validate.py`. Import this module into a game loop or editor; it has no automatic runtime side effects.

## Adaptation checklist

Choose units and coordinate conventions. Validate external inputs at the application boundary. Add tests for your game's scale, determinism, error handling, and performance before shipping. This module is independent of other mechanics.
