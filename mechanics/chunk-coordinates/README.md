# World-to-chunk coordinates

## Mechanic and algorithm

Split integer world coordinates into chunk coordinates and nonnegative local coordinates. Floor division is essential for negative positions: tile -1 belongs to chunk -1, local size-1.

## Read the implementation

[`python/example.py`](python/example.py) is an independent, standard-library-only Python 3.10+ module. Comments highlight decisions worth changing for your own game. There are no engine dependencies or runtime side effects on import.

## Working example and behavioral check

From the repository root:

```sh
python3 tools/validate.py
python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -p test_genre_mechanics.py -k chunk_coordinates -v
```

The corresponding `test_chunk_coordinates` in [the test suite](../../tests/test_genre_mechanics.py) demonstrates real calls, expected outputs, and boundary or rejection cases. For interactive use:

```python
import importlib.util
spec = importlib.util.spec_from_file_location("mechanic", "mechanics/chunk-coordinates/python/example.py")
mechanic = importlib.util.module_from_spec(spec)
spec.loader.exec_module(mechanic)
# Use the public functions/classes shown in the behavioral test.
```

## Assumptions and limits

2D coordinate mapping only, no chunk streaming, mesh generation, file I/O, or floating-origin management.

Tune the rules for your game and extend the tests before integrating. Educational coverage is not a full genre implementation or a production-readiness guarantee. This entry currently has Python code; other language ports are not present.
