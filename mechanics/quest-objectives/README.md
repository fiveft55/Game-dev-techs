# Quest objective tracking

<!-- BEGIN PLAIN ENGLISH -->
## Plain-English explanation

Track jobs such as collecting two logs and talking to one villager.

1. Give each job a target count.
2. Add progress when its event happens.
3. Stop each counter at its target; extra logs do not make the counter run forever.
4. The quest is complete only when every job is complete. Persistent reward claiming needs extra storage rules.

See [PORTS.md](PORTS.md) for actual inputs, outputs and a worked example. The [beginner guide](../../docs/beginner-guide.md) explains common coding words.

## Mechanic and algorithm

Count named gameplay events toward required targets, clamp progress to the target, and allow a completed quest reward to be claimed exactly once. Event types are stable developer-defined identifiers.

## Read the implementation

[`python/example.py`](python/example.py) is an independent, standard-library-only Python 3.10+ module. Comments highlight decisions worth changing for your own game. There are no engine dependencies or runtime side effects on import.

## Working example and behavioral check

From the repository root:

```sh
python3 tools/validate.py
python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -p test_genre_mechanics.py -k quest_objectives -v
```

The corresponding `test_quest_objectives` in [the test suite](../../tests/test_genre_mechanics.py) demonstrates real calls, expected outputs, and boundary or rejection cases. For interactive use:

```python
import importlib.util
spec = importlib.util.spec_from_file_location("mechanic", "mechanics/quest-objectives/python/example.py")
mechanic = importlib.util.module_from_spec(spec)
spec.loader.exec_module(mechanic)
# Use the public functions/classes shown in the behavioral test.
```

## Assumptions and limits

An in-memory single-player rule. A persistent service must make reward payout and claimed-state updates atomic and validate that events really happened.

Tune the rules for your game and extend the tests before integrating. Educational coverage is not a full genre implementation or a production-readiness guarantee. The original Python API is preserved. Eight additional native kernels are available; see the portable contract for their API and scope differences.
